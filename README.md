# AI for producing electronic music

Final project for the Building AI course

## Summary

The idea is to build an AI-based music program for electronic music creation. It could start from creating settings for software instruments, progress to loops for single instruments and variations of them. Gradually it could learn to combine more and more loops and finally produce complete pieces of electronic music in various genres. 

## Background

I have done some non-professional electronic music in the past as well as played as a DJ. I've seen the shift from vinyls, cds and analogue synthetizers to DJs playing files and musicians using completeley digital software instruments. Thus the first idea that came to my mind when I entered the university and learned about machine learning, was to go even further along the path of programming the music. 

## Discussion

I see this kind of an AI as an instrument for electronic music production. Do the programmers become musicians this way? I don't know. Given favorable conditions, the instrument plays itself. The successful implementation of the AI could open new dimensions to humans producing electronic music by compositions and parameter tweaks, that no human had thought before. On the other hand, it might be that the AI would never produce anything any human would prefer over music produced without it. I don't see this AI having dramatic effects to electronic music culture even if it would become commercialized and the number of 'artists' would increase.

## Data sources and AI methods

The AI would use existing pieces of music and samples of software instruments in the music program chosen to be the platform. This would require collaboration with as many artists as possible. Also record labels could be included, maybe even the company behind the music program used in the project. This project would be based on machine learning, other AI techniques would most likely not be used.
